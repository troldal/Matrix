# Matrix
A simple matrix class for linear algebra.

This was an attempt to make my own matrix class for linear algebra. It is not complete, but it does have some basic functionality.
In the end, I decided to use the Blaze library instead, which is much more complete and has a lot more functionality. I keep this here for reference.
